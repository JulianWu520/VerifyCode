# VerifyCode
Distinguish from the verify code by machine learning.

Usage: VerifyCode.py -f PictureName -m r

e.g.  VerifyCode.py -f 1.bmp -m r

I would like to add some words in readme is that this machine learnning just has a very simple mdoe file. So,if you wanted to distinguish the complex code is very hard,maybe you have to rewrite the algorithm of some part of the program,i hope this program may help you to get a example for you. 

I also want to appreciate these two author,because their article help us so much!
